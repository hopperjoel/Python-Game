# Python-Game

This game was completed as an assignment for a class. The objective of the assignment was to create a game using the Python Arcade library and to demonstrate adequate use of OOP principles including encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance.

The game runs from the __main__.py file, and the root folder contains all of the necessary game files.
